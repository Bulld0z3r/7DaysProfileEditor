# 7DaysProfileEditor 0.14.4.1
Tool for editing *.ttp files made by 7 Days To Die

The program is still in Alpha and is unfinished. For now, you can only change your inventory and skills.
It uses 7DaysSaveManipulator.dll to read and write to the *.ttp

You need to have 7DaysSaveManipulator.dll in the same folder as the 7DaysProfileEditor.exe for it to work.
